    <p><h3>The Mother of Boards</h3></p>
        <img src="http://images.anandtech.com/doci/7008/image004.png"/>
        <p>This piece of technology is what makes the world go round. In reality, it is advance piece of technology that makes the computer opperate that way it is.</p> 
        <p>It has a physical description of a thin metal plate that has circuit on it; looking like mazes but electrified.</p>

        <p>The processor is what distinguishes a computer from a screen covered by aluminum.</p> 
        <p>Having a cutting edge processor can make the user have a great computer that can carry out all the commands it is told.</p> 
        <p>And for the people who have many hobbies, having a strong processor can make amnaging task more efficent and less buffering.</p>

        <p><h3>Randon Access Memory</h3></p>
        <img src="http://www.iconarchive.com/download/i55333/aroche/delta/RAM.ico"/>
        <p>RAM helps your computer run faster. It's not because the RAM is a faster processor that makes it your computer run fast. RAM just </p>
        <p>"rememebers" not to distant information, like tabs being refesh, to make the display of the information faster.</p>
        <p>The physical desription is of a rectangle with small, usually four, cubes ontop.</p>

        <p>The hard drive is the computer storage. This can be easily confused with the RAM except that the hard drive is more personal; it </p>
        <p>saves everything you have. This ranges from music to passwords.</p>

        <p><h3>Keys on a board</h3></p>
        <img src="http://www.qpad.com/uploads/images/Shop-Template/Keyboards/MK85/mk85-overviuew-main.png"/>
        <p>The main function of a keyboard is for typing. Having evolved over time, it hasn't changed much of its shapes. However</p>
        <p>new commands have been added to the keyboard such as symbols and shortcuts.</p>

        <p><h3>Mouse</h3></p>

        <p>The mouse doesn't really have much importance to the operating of a computer since most keyboads have a mousepad. Back to</p>
        <p>the mouse, it displace a small arrow on the screen which allos the user to click one of two buttons that the actual mouse has.</p>
        <p>The left button allows the user to select whatever the mouse hovers over. The right button opens a list of commands that are accessible</p>
        <p>to the user; the commands range from copy, paste, cut, and many other settings.</p>

        <p>Looking live a flat screen t.v, the monitor displays the computers function.</p>

        <p><h3>BUS</h3></p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Computer_system_bus.svg/2000px-Computer_system_bus.svg.png" width=400px; height=400px />
        <p>BUS is the gap between the process of transfering data. When downloading a file, the amount of data transfering at a second is all determined</p>
        <p> by the size of the BUS. AN example being, if you have 32 bit (bit being a computer measuring type) the more data can be transfered at a time.</p>
        <p>The higher the bit, the more data is transfered when downloading/transfering data.</p>
